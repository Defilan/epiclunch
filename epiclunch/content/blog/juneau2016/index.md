### [Fish and Chips](https://www.hangaronthewharf.com/) with a side of glacier
There are times when you just want to do something a little bit crazy. When I first started working in the airline business, a few of my friends wanted to take a trip with me to do something fun. As I did not have a lot of vacation time built up yet, the idea of an Epic Lunch Run was born. What destination could we choose that would be fun, but also somewhat outlandish, for lunch? Two of my good friends, Ben and Chuck, are also former coworkers at a different company.  When we all worked together on the same team, our idea of a far-out lunch was driving from Seattle to Issaquah (around 17miles) for some BBQ. After looking at what flights we could theoretically take in a morning and then return in the afternoon, all while finding some fun stuff to do during the day, Juneau, AK was where we settled on going.

I had only been to Juneau once before in my life and that was on a cruise with my family back in high school. I was so excited to adventure with some friends, in search of some great sights and tasty food. Early in the morning on March 16th, we arrived at our gate and boarded our plane. This was the first trip by plane I had taken with these guys, and we had a blast, just joking around and admiring the incredible views out the window as we approached Juneau.

One thing that made our trip to Juneau easy was the relative ease of getting around via taxi. Fun fact, Juneau is not accessible by car from outside of town. You must either fly in or come by boat. The main road in town is only a few miles long!

The first stop we wanted to make on our epic trip was to the Mendenhall Glacier. Since we took our trip during the middle of March, we were the only ones there as seasonal tourists wouldn’t be coming for a few more months. As we had the park pretty much to ourselves, we were able to walk all around and get some incredible shots of the glacier. We even saw some of the glacier calving, which caused a mini tsunami in the water! It was quite the sight and made for a fun adventure. This was Chuck and Ben’s first time to Alaska, and they were awestruck by glacier.

After our trip to the glacier, we hopped back into a taxi and drove into Downtown Juneau, where we were on a mission to find some killer fish and chips. We ended up at a restaurant called Hanger on the Warf, which was highly recommend to us by our taxi driver. The place didn’t disappoint. We enjoyed fish and chips and some Alaskan Amber beer. The views were amazing from the restaurant!

With our stomachs full and time winding down, we hopped back into another taxi and drove off to the airport, beginning our journey back to Seattle. Our flight home was short and enjoyable, again with some incredible views. 

Juneau is a trip I would recommend for any person who wants to do something fun that doesn’t require a rental car or a ton of time away. We took a flight in the morning, spent a good four hours on the ground, and flew back. We were back by the mid-afternoon. If you find yourself seeking out your next adventure and are craving some views with great food, I’d highly recommend making Juneau your next non-revving destination!
