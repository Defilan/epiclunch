One of my goals as an airlines employee is looking for new ways to push the envelope of sanity when looking for a trip for some good food. Most of the “lunch runs” you’ll find on this site are for true day trips but there are many other adventures to be had that require an overnight. This is the story of one of my favorite trips so far. I was born in Houston, TX and while we moved to Seattle when I was in elementary school, I still have family there and would visit often growing up. Houston is always a second home to me. One thing that Houston is known for is having some of the best food in the entire world.

I’ve talked with my friends about the amazing food in Houston for years and during a meeting at work, my buddy David asked about taking a quick trip to Houston. I’ve had an itinerary in my back pocket for just such an occasion! A few days later, we took the 5:40PM flight from Seattle to Houston. The flight was wonderful, as we were able to catch some incredible views of Mt. Rainier from the air on our way down south.

We arrived at IAH around 11:45PM and rented a car. One of my go to apps while traveling is called Hotel Tonight. We were able to find a place to crash close to downtown for a screaming deal. On the way to the hotel, we were hungry and when you’re hungry late-night in Texas, the place to visit is called Whataburger. If you ask folks around Houston where to get their late-night burgers, Whataburger (pronounced “Waterburger” by locals), is where you’ll be pointed. David and I each had our fill on Bacon and Cheese Whataburgers and crashed for the night.

Growing up in Houston, TexMex is king when it comes to breakfast. A family favorite of our is called Migas, which is a TexMex egg dish with strips of tortillas and spices cooked together and eaten in corn tortillas. David and went to the Buffalo Grille on Bissonnet street and had a feast. Coffee, migas, grits, fresh tortillas, and some amazing salsa covered our table. This was the best way to start our day!

Since we just tanked up on breakfast, we took the 35minute drive from Buffalo Grille out to NASA’s Johnson Space Center. Being a huge NASA nerd since I was a kid, visiting this place is a must whenever I’m in town. When you arrive, the Rocket Park is free and open to visitors. Inside this immense structure is the world’s only fully intact, mission ready Saturn V rocket. Each section is exposed, allowing you to walk around it and admire it up close. Even to this day, the Saturn V is still the most powerful machine humans have ever built, burning 20tons of fuel per second with over 7.5million pounds of thrust during its first stage burn. It’s truly an engineering marvel.

Once we finished looking at the rockets at the park, David and I drove back into town to visit my uncle’s Harley Davidson dealership. We toured around looking at the bikes they had in stock and began to head out to my favorite spot for lunch in Houston: Goode Company Taqueria. When in town for lunch at Goode Company, I highly recommend getting their beef fajitas plate. Mouthwatering beef is served sizzling with onions and peppers along with tortillas, guacamole, cheese, and beans. We washed this down with some Shiner beer. Saying this lunch was incredible doesn’t do it justice.

After our epic meal at Goode Company, we drove back to IAH, dropped off the car, and hung out at the airport for the 4:05PM flight home. After a smooth flight, we landed back in Seattle a mere 25hrs after we departed, having successfully enjoyed three meals in Houston as well as a trip to NASA.

This is a trip I won’t forget and one I want to take again soon. Trips like this do not have to be expensive. With apps like Hotel Tonight and quick 24hr car rentals, you can get out and explore great places to visit and eat for a reasonable amount of money, especially if splitting the costs with some friends. Houston is a fantastic city filled with great people, culture, and places to eat. I recommend taking a trip there soon, you won’t regret it!
