### Pizza at [The Summit](https://www.snowbird.com/dining/the-summit)(11,000ft)
One of my favorite non-revving trips I've taken was to Salt Lake City back in February a couple of years back. Two of my good buddies, Chuck and Ben, were my travel companions for the day. We tried to make it a quarterly tradition to do an Epic Lunch Run to someplace new. Over a meal a few weeks prior to our trip, we were trying to figure out where to go. My friend Ben went to college at the University of Utah and mentioned how great the ski resorts were up there. It was at this moment that the idea of doing a day trip to Salt Lake City came to be.

At the wee hours on February 15th, the three of us got to SeaTac airport and boarded our flight from SEA to SLC. Since it was still winter, the views outside the plane were amazing. Snow was everywhere once we made it over Eastern Washington. Along the way towards SLC, we were greeted by incredible sights.

After landing, the three of us rented a car and decided to take the 33mile drive up to the Snowbird Ski Resort. Ben used to ski here and raved about the slopes and the views from the top of the mountain. We all purchased gondola passes and took the long journey up to the top of the mountain. To say the views from the gondola were breathtaking wouldn’t do it justice, it was truly paradise up there.

At the top of the resort, around 11,000ft, is a restaurant called The Summit. It was up at this mind-blowing altitude that Chuck, Ben, and I enjoyed some tasty grub. Chuck and I got pizza and Ben opted for some chili. We decided to take our food outside and eat at some picnic tables next to the restaurant. Pizza and chili at 11,000ft is something I’ll never forget.

After we had our fill, we walked around the summit and looked at the sights. We were also eyeing some sweet runs that we wanted to explore on our next trip here with skis in tow. Shortly after this, we took the gondola back down to the parking lot and hopped in our car. Ben showed us around some of his old stomping grounds from his college days and we drove back to the airport. We boarded our flight and were in back in Seattle in a short 2 hours. 

This is a day trip that I would quickly recommend to my friends who want an easy and affordable epic lunch run. The sights were amazing, the stories were fantastic (who gets to say they had pizza and chili at 11,000ft for lunch), and the trip could easily be taken in a single workday. Salt Lake City is also a great non-rev location for young families. Their public transportation system is solid, and you can get from the airport to many difference places without needing to rent a car or bring car seats. I highly recommend it for a random and fun daytrip. I’m already looking forward to my next trip to the Summit for a slice and some stunning views.
