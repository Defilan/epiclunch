### Pizza at [The Summit](https://www.snowbird.com/dining/the-summit)(11,000ft)
One of my favorite non-revving trips I've taken was to Salt Lake City back in February a couple of years back. Two of my good buddies, Chuck and Ben, were my travel companions for the day. We tried to make it a quarterly tradition to do an Epic Lunch Run to someplace new. Over a meal a few weeks prior to our trip, we were trying to figure out where to go. My friend Ben went to college at the University of Utah and mentioned how great the ski resorts were up there. It was at this moment that the idea of doing a day trip to Salt Lake City came to be.

At the wee hours on February 15th, the three of us got to SeaTac airport and boarded our flight from SEA to SLC. Since it was still winter, the views outside the plane were amazing. Snow was everywhere once we made it over Eastern Washington. Along the way towards SLC, we were greeted by incredible sights.

After landing, the three of us rented a car and decided to take the 33mile drive up to the Snowbird Ski Resort. Ben used to ski here and raved about the slopes and the views from the top of the mountain. We all purchased gondola passes and took the long journey up to the top of the mountain. To say the views from the gondola were breathtaking wouldnâ€™t do it justice, it was truly paradise up there.
